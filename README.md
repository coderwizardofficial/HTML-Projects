<!--HTML Basic to table
Your Assignment
1. Review the tutorial link sections from the left Menu HTML Basic through HTML Tables to learn HTML concepts.  These
sections will give you enough information to complete the assignment.  You should do them in order so that each builds
more knowledge upon the previous topic.
2. Create a new web page in the assessment Code editor using what you learned from the tutorial.  The results will be
displayed in the Display window.  Your page should fulfill the following minimum specifications:
a. Heading centered H1 with text "My First HTML Page" color dark blue. 
b. Paragraph with at least 30 words describing the page.  You can copy text from anywhere or make it up.
c. Two pictures from the image library folder side by side 200x300 pixels each with alt text description. 
You can access the image library folder by clicking on the Images bar above the Code and Display windows to expand the
folder to show thumbnails of the available images.  To use an image just click on it to copy its URL to the clipboard
then you can paste the URL into your code.  To shrink the image library folder just click on the Images bar again. 
d. Centered menu with 4 buttons light blue with black text labels (descriptive) with links to 4 external websites of
your choice. Links must open in a new window or tab using the target="_blank" attribute. 
This assessment system uses iframes to view separate windows within a single page.  Note that some websites will not
open within another page or iframe.  Those sites must be linked using the target="_blank" attribute or they will not
operate with your project.   
e. A simple HTML table with a Header containing Firstname, Lastname, City, State, and Birth Month.  The table must have
5 elements centered under each column.  You make up names and etc.   
You may add additional complexity to show off your stuff!
